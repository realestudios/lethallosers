# Gather 'round, losers!


### v69 compatible. Start with fresh pack for 4.0.0 update!

## 

Modpack for my lethal crew, but you'll enjoy it too!

With this modpack, you can:

- Play with up to 32 friends

- Use cosmetics and extra suits to distinguish yourself from others

- Travel to new moons

- Buy new store items and other misc. upgrades in the terminal

- Gamble at the Company Building

- Spend your hard-earned cash on game-changing upgrades

- Run from new enemies and hazards

Also includes quality of life mods and many other additions.

Most things have been customized from defaults. This pack is regularly updated to ensure nothing breaks and to keep things fresh!

You need at least 16gb RAM to use this pack. If you have 8gb or less, you can use my other pack, LethalLosersCompatibility, which doesn't have custom moons.

If running on Linux and 16gb RAM, make sure you have an active swap partition or the game will crash when loading.
