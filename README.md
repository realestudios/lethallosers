# Gather 'round, losers!


### LethalLevelLoader, LethalLevelLoaderFixed, and LethalExpansionCore MUST be disabled for v50 compatibility!!! The game will break if you do not do so. This should be installed with a fresh profile if you used previous versions of the pack, or else things will break.

It is best to start with a clean pack. You can feel free to update all mods in the pack and add to it after.


Modpack for my lethal crew. Enjoy!

With this modpack, you can:

-Play with up to 32 friends
-Use cosmetics and extra suits to distinguish yourself from others
-Travel to new moons
-Buy new store items and other misc. upgrades in the terminal
-Gamble at the Company Building
-Spend your hard-earned cash on game-changing upgrades
-Run from new enemies and hazards

Also includes quality of life mods and many other additions.


## CHANGELOG:

### 3.2.5

Fixed a typo in the changelog

### 3.2.4

Removed SelfKick and added Bikini Bottom as a moon. If you are having syncronization issues, or if reloading the shotgun breaks the game, disabling SelfKick seems to work.

### 3.2.3

Added SelfKick. If you get stuck in the void when joining a server, press F8 and you will be kicked without needing to restart.

### 3.2.2

Fixed meltdown escape music. Removed redundant dependancy. Removed irrelevant config files.

Added some new enemies
