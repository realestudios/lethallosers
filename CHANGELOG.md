##

Use this version if you need LethalExpansion.

Added back LethalLeverLoaderv50, which fixes the terminal and lets you land on Ganimedes and Bozoros. You can either update just this mod, or start with a clean profile.

Updated the mods that can safely be updated. Start with a clean pack and do not update

### 3.2.6

Updated config files

### 3.2.5

Fixed a typo in the changelog
