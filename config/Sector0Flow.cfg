## Settings file was created by plugin Sector0Flow v1.0.0
## Plugin GUID: Sector0Flow

[General]

## How rare it is for Sector0Flow to be chosen. Higher values increases the chance of spawning the dungeon. Vanillas' main dungeons use a value of 300. Google Weighted Random if you don't know how it works, as that's how Lethal Company rarities function.
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 300
SectorRarity = 300

## The moon(s) that Sector0Flow can spawn on, in the form of a comma separated list of selectable level names and optionally a weight value by using an '@' and weight value after it (e.g. "Titan@300,Dine,Rend@10,Sector@450")
## The name matching is lenient and should pick it up if you use the terminal name or internal mod name. If no rarity is specified, the SectorRarity parameter is used.
## The following strings: "all", "vanilla", "modded", "paid", "free" are dynamic presets which add the dungeon to that specified group (string must only contain one of these, or a manual moon name list).
## 
# Setting type: String
# Default value: Sector@450
SectorMoonsList = Sector@450

## If not -1, overrides Sector0Flow length to whatever you'd like. Adjusts how long/large the dungeon generates.
## Be *EXTREMELY* careful not to set this too high (anything too big on a moon with a high dungeon size multipier can cause catastrophic problems, like crashing your computer or worse)
## For reference, the default value for the current version [1.0.0] is 6. If it's too big, make this lower e.g. 6, if it's too small use something like 10 (or higher, but don't go too crazy with it).
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: -1
SectorLengthOverride = -1
